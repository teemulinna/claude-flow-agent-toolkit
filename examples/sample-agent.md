# Sample Analyzer Agent

This is a sample agent demonstrating proper configuration for code analysis tasks.

## Purpose

Analyzes code quality and detects patterns across JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Code Quality Analysis** - Assess code quality metrics
2. **Pattern Detection** - Find common anti-patterns
3. **Metric Calculation** - Calculate complexity and maintainability

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Trigger: "analyze code quality in src/"
# The agent will scan all JS/TS files and generate a quality report
```

### Pattern Detection
```bash
# Trigger: "check for anti-patterns in the codebase"
# The agent will identify common issues and suggest improvements
```

## Integration

- Works with: code-reviewer agent for comprehensive reviews
- Provides: analysis reports that can be used by other agents
- Security: Read-only access ensures no code modifications

## Best Practices

1. Run analysis before code reviews
2. Use for continuous quality monitoring
3. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
4. Review metrics trends over time
